For this assignment I used a intel® Core™ i5-4200U CPU @ 1.60GHz × 4 processor. After timing the execution of program MPI_trap.c with various problem sizes and 1, 2, 3, 4 processes. I concluded that using 4 processes was the fastest (2.79 secs) at executing the program, but not by much compared to using 3 (3.34) or 2 (3.11) processors. The major variance in time was when I used only 1 processor (5.53 secs).
